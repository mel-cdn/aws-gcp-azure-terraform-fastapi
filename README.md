# Dunder Mifflin Inventory Service

[![PROD Build Status](https://github.com/mel-cdn/dm-inventory-service/actions/workflows/gcp_deploy.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/mel-cdn/dm-inventory-service/actions/workflows/gcp_deploy.yml)

## Overview

This repository is a sandbox project for experimenting with **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)** principles using a **FastAPI
** application.  
It simulates managing paper product inventory, sales personnel, and sales transactions â€” inspired by *Dunder Mifflin*.

## Highlights

- Domain-Driven Design architecture with FastAPI
- Containerized with Docker
- Deployment targets: Google Cloud Platform (GCP) and Amazon Web Services (AWS)
- Infrastructure as Code via Terraform (for both GCP and AWS)
- Automated CI/CD using GitHub Actions
